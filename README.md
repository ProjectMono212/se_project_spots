# Project 3: Spots

**Intro**

![Spots Demo](https://github.com/ProjectMono212/se_project_spots/releases/download/se_project_spots_gif/spots.gif)

Spots is a responsive web application that allows users to create profiles and share their favorite locations. Whether it's a hidden gem restaurant, a perfect coffee shop, a scenic viewpoint, or a great place to take a break, users can post about cool spots they've discovered and build a collection of memorable places.

The application features a clean, modern interface built with HTML5, CSS3, and responsive design principles. Users can view spot cards in an adaptive grid layout that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The design emphasizes visual content with square image cards and intuitive navigation.

**Key Features:**

- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- User profiles with avatar, name, and description
- Interactive post creation with "New Post" functionality
- Clean card-based design for spot sharing
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
- Cross-browser compatibility

**Future Updates**

In upcoming versions, Spots will be enhanced with JavaScript functionality to enable dynamic user interactions, including form handling, image uploads, and real-time content updates. Additionally, a backend database will be integrated to support user authentication, data persistence, and full CRUD operations for managing spots and user profiles.
